# Demographic Visibility Gap Analysis

Generated: 2025-12-24T04:12:14.415823+00:00

## Overview

This analysis examines which demographic groups are most 'invisible' to the NYC Community Health Survey.

**Key metrics:**
- **n_eff (effective sample size)**: Higher = more survey respondents = better visibility
- **Suppression rate**: Percentage of estimates marked as unreliable/suppressed

## Visibility by Demographic Group

### By Neighborhood_Race

| Group | Mean n_eff | Suppression Rate | N Estimates |
|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| South Bronx | 23 | 66.7% | 1 |
| East and Central Harlem | 79 | 33.3% | 2 |
| North and Central Brooklyn | 73 | 0.0% | 3 |
| All other neighborhoods | 1253 | 0.0% | 3 |

### By Age

| Group | Mean n_eff | Suppression Rate | N Estimates |
|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| 18-24 Years | 383 | 0.0% | 3 |
| 25-44 Years | 1219 | 0.0% | 3 |
| 65 and over | 710 | 0.0% | 3 |
| 45-64 Years | 1146 | 0.0% | 3 |

### By Poverty

| Group | Mean n_eff | Suppression Rate | N Estimates |
|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Lowest poverty (highest income) | 776 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Medium poverty (med income) | 581 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Low poverty (higher income) | 699 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Highest poverty (lowest income) | 895 | 0.0% | 3 |
| High poverty (low income) | 778 | 0.0% | 3 |

### By Sex

| Group | Mean n_eff | Suppression Rate | N Estimates |
|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Female | 2452 | 0.0% | 1 |
| Male | 1893 | 0.0% | 1 |

### By Race

| Group | Mean n_eff | Suppression Rate | N Estimates |
|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| White | 1347 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Other | 151 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Latino | 1037 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Black | 792 | 0.0% | 3 |
| Asian/Pacific Islander | 444 | 0.0% | 3 |

## Key Findings

### Most Invisible Groups (Highest Suppression)

- **South Bronx** (neighborhood_race): 66.7% suppressed
- **East and Central Harlem** (neighborhood_race): 33.3% suppressed
- **18-24 Years** (age): 0.0% suppressed
- **Lowest poverty (highest income)** (poverty): 0.0% suppressed
- **Female** (sex): 0.0% suppressed

### Most Visible Groups (Lowest Suppression)

- **18-24 Years** (age): 0.0% suppressed
- **Lowest poverty (highest income)** (poverty): 0.0% suppressed
- **Female** (sex): 0.0% suppressed
- **White** (race): 0.0% suppressed
- **Other** (race): 0.0% suppressed

## Interpretation

Groups with high suppression rates are **underrepresented** in the survey.
This may indicate:
- Smaller population size
- Lower survey response rates
- Harder to reach populations

**Policy implication:** These groups may be systematically missed by survey-based health monitoring.
