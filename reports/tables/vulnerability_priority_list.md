# Visibility Vulnerability Priority List

## Overview
Neighborhoods ranked by combined **consequence** (health burden) and **invisibility** (survey underrepresentation).

High vulnerability = neighborhoods with significant health issues that are poorly captured by surveys.

## Interpretation

- **Consequence Score (0-100):** Based on hospitalization and mortality rates. Higher = worse health outcomes.
- **Invisibility Score (0-100):** Based on survey underrepresentation. Higher = less visible to surveys.
- **Vulnerability Score:** Average of consequence and invisibility.

## Policy Implications

Neighborhoods with high vulnerability scores may:
- Be underrepresented in health surveys
- Have health issues that are not captured in official statistics
- Benefit from targeted outreach and data collection efforts
